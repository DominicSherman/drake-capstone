To better organize our code and allow for code reusability, we set the analytics components as their own files. 

Analytics- anything on the analytics page
Media- Any Social Media Platform Media data- likes, comments, etc.
UserInfo- User profile information- name, hometown, interests, etc.

Components get passed to a screen, under the 'screens' folder in src. 

The names of files are intended to give the best possible description of their purpose.
